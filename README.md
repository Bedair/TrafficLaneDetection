# Traffic Lane Detection using Python-OpenCV

##### An autonomous car (also known as a driverless car, self-driving car, robotic car, and unmanned ground vehicle) is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input.[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car)

##### Autonomous cars use a variety of techniques to detect their surroundings, such as radar, laser light, GPS, odometry and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage Autonomous cars must have control systems that are capable of analyzing sensory data to distinguish between different cars on the road.[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car)

##### In this project we are using Computer Vision technology to detect the Traffic Lanes. We are Using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) with [Python](https://www.python.org/) Interface which enable us to use the original C/C++ OpenCV library but in python.
